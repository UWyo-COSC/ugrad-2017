# Undergraduate Curricular Revision 2017

The goals of this revision effort are as follows:

1. Update the curriculum to reflect contemporary computing practice.
2. Streamline the prerequisite chain 
   * to improve on-time completion chances for transfer students,
   * to allow studens to switch into the program as sophomores or juniors, and
   * to create pathways for non-majors to take more of our courses, especially upper-division courses of broad appeal.
3. Reconsider requirements for a Minor in Computer Science.
4. Adopt one or more Certificates in Computer Science, e.g., for Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, etc.
