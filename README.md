# Undergraduate Curricular Revision 2017

The goals of this revision effort are as follows:

1. Update the curriculum to reflect contemporary computing practice.
2. Address "gaps" in our program:
   * Compiling large programming projects.
   * A portfolio of student work.
   * Parallel/Distributed computing.
3. Streamline the prerequisite chain
   * to improve on-time completion chances for transfer students,
   * to allow studens to switch into the program as sophomores or juniors, and
   * to create pathways for non-majors to take more of our courses, especially upper-division courses of broad appeal.
4. Reconsider requirements for a Minor in Computer Science.
5. Adopt one or more Certificates in Computer Science, e.g., for Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, etc.
6. Convert the "regular" special topics into actual COSC courses.
7. Maintain high expectations for the majors in our program. In particular, we wish to distinguish ourselves from other computer science programs in the region by the fact that our students are the most qualified programmers you can hire.
